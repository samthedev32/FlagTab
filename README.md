# FlagTab
What the name says; a tab that is purely just a flag.

You can set a custom **icon** and **color** alongside with a **title** to make it *REALLY* pop out from your other tabs, so you can have some level of organisation between them.

If you want to, you can use it at [flag.cant.hu](https://flag.cant.hu)
